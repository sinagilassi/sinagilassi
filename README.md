ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sinagilassi

I specialize in the modeling and optimization of chemical processes, with a strong foundation in mass and energy balances, kinetic modeling, and numerical analysis. My passion for chemistry has driven me to apply Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the study of catalytic reaction mechanisms. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and chemical engineering, particularly its applications in reaction modeling and process optimization. Beyond research, I enjoy coding and developing scientific tools that enhance our understanding of complex chemical systems.
